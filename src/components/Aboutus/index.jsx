      <p>At our organization, we have forged a strategic partnership with the Pune Municipal Corporation, leveraging collaborative efforts to tackle the pervasive issue of open garbage dumps in urban areas. Our approach is rooted in data-driven insights, as we have conducted a comprehensive survey across diverse city wards to gather extensive data on garbage collection frequencies and prevalent waste types. Engaging directly with municipal officers, we have emphasized the critical urgency of the problem and advocated for a technology-driven solution. Utilizing cutting-edge big data techniques, we have developed a robust application aimed at effectively addressing the challenges posed by open garbage dumps in urban environments. Our commitment to innovation and collaboration underscores our dedication to fostering cleaner, healthier communities for all residents.</p>

<br/>

Our solution introduces innovative features such as location tracing for user complaints, allowing users to specify the ward, recyclability, and waste type, thereby enabling more efficient waste management. Additionally, we have designed a worker Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with functionalities like filtering complaints by location and type, enhancing worker productivity and effectiveness.

<br/>

We have developed a user-friendly interface for municipal administrators to monitor complaints effectively, providing real-time insights into garbage disposal issues. Furthermore, our system suggests redirecting worker paths to the nearest available recycling center, promoting sustainable waste management practices.
